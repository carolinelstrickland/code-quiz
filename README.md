For this project, I was asked to create a multiple choice quiz with a timer and the ability to store and rank scores. 

After my HTML and styling, I need to create a function to start the quiz from an on click button selection. Once selected, a 45 second timer will begin along with the presentation of the first question. The right or wrong answer is indicated in the console log. If the wrong answer is selected, 15 seconds will be removed from the timer, and the next question will be displayed. After answering all of the questions, the question container will be removed, and the user is will be left with the value of their seconds remaining for quiz completion. This number will act as the highscore.  

On this last page, there will be a text box with an accompanying submit button to type in the username and store that score. Through local storage application, the scores will be ranked from highest to lowest until cleared.
